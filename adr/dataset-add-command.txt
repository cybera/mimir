Dataset add command syntax

Status: draft

Context:

We're trying to establish what the user workflows are going to be for
adding different types of datasets. We'd like those workflows to use
consistent idioms so a user isn't confused, and their experience with
one workflow helps make understanding other workflows clearer.

Decision:

Our workflows should be as follows:

local:
  $ ccds dataset add kittykats.csv --from /home/cam/download/adoption.csv
   
generated:
  $ ccds dataset add bestkats.csv --generated --dependencies=kittykats
 
remote:
  $ ccds dataset add breedinfo.csv --source swift --from spca/breedinfo.csv

Future decisions:

We'll likely want a more expressive form of describing where remote datasets are, especially as all the datasets may not be in the same remote location:

  $ ccds remote add rac --oooh-magic-oooh
  $ ccds dataset add breedinfo.csv --remote rac --from spca/breedinfo.csv
